subtitle: "Why the \"Aldea\" exists?"
---

The "Aldea" (Spanish word for Village) is a community that seeks to share knowledge. Created with the only hope that can be of benefit to anyone who is willing to learn. It was born as a hobby to keep the information acquired laborally and wants to remain as a knowledge database for the future.

English is not my native language, so, you are warned! :)
